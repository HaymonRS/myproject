                <h2>C</h2>
                <h3>C is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope
                    and recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access
                    to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal
                    runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage
                    cross-platform programming.</h3>

                <h2>C++</h2>
                <h3>C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large
                    systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[14]
                    C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software
                    infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[14] including desktop applications, video
                    games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications.

                <h3>Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a
                    core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java
                    compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary
                    licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun
                    had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. .</h3>
